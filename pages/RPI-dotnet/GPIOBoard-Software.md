This was the projects that I created for the solution. There are three projects *LEDButtonApp*, *LEDButtonLib* and *LEDButtonLibTests*.
The other files *tasks.json*, *launch.json* and *publish.ps1* are scripts to build, publish (to the Raspberry Pi), and run the code. The remaining items are *.gitignore* for git and *Doc* which is where I would store all the documentation for GitHub.

# LedButtonApp
This is the main executable. I decided to do this as a console app.

# LedButtonLib
This is the library with the code that interfaces with the board.

# LedButtonLibTests
I decided to write a set of unit tests for the library.

You can find [the source here][gpio-board-github], but here are a few notes:

- The console app uses commandlineparser to make things easier. This project is pretty straightforward.
- The LedButtonLib uses the [.NET Core IoT Libraries][dotnet-iot] which seem very well written and maintained.
- I decided to have separate classes for the LEDs, buttons (and eventually fan and piezo) and it became apparent that I needed a base class (CustomController) which has all the construction and disposal code.
- The tests use mocking ([Moq][moq]). I couldn't mock the GpioController, so I mocked the GpioDevice instead. To do this I had to use the Protected method in Moq.
