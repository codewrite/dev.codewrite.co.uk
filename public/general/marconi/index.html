        <p>I was at Marconi for about four years. I was actually sponsored by them, so I spent nine months before my final year working for them over in Frimley.
During that time I was working on a new CMOS 8086 interrupt controller. There were only five of these in the whole of Europe, so I was told to try and not blow it up!
One of the senior engineers (Dr someone or other&hellip;) had written a program to test this chip. It failed the test but they didn&rsquo;t know why. So that was my task. The NMOS version worked, so I had something to compare it against. Anyway, long story short, it turned out that there was a masking error, and if you configured the chip in a certain way the interrupts wouldn&rsquo;t get processed correctly because two tracks were effectively too close together. In later years I would come across similar problems in memory chips - where they worked with certain data patterns but not others. That lead to a me writing a memory test that I believe is still is still used in Phoenix BIOSes - but thats another story.</p>
<p>When I started having graduated I quickly started working on test software and firmware using Pascal and 8086 assembler on IBM PCs.
But I enjoyed working on all sorts of computers - one of the tasks I took on was hacking into a CPM system where everyone had forgotten their password. There was still a way to get in (I think via an admin account) which allowed me to view the password &ldquo;database&rdquo;. That gave me hashed passwords. Rather naively (with hindsight) I thought if I could work out the hashing algorithm I could work out the passwords. So I tried creating accounts with passwords &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;b&rdquo;, &ldquo;c&rdquo; etc., and then &ldquo;aa&rdquo;, &ldquo;ab&rdquo; etc. It didn&rsquo;t take me long to reverse engineer their hacking algorithm (it was a good job they didn&rsquo;t have a non-reversible algorithm). I&rsquo;m still interested in security and reading about security failures and how to avoid them; I&rsquo;m not a security expert, but I know enough to know that you don&rsquo;t try and invent your own security algorithms and systems!</p>
<p>After about a year I moved over to the application software group writing the real code in Coral66. I was made team leader of the &ldquo;Intelligence and Meteorology&rdquo; team. Looking back, the architecture was quite advanced for it&rsquo;s time.</p>
