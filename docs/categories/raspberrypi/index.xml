I have a camera that looks out over the front garden using a Raspberry Pi 3. It&amp;rsquo;s has quite a low resolution and frame rate (deliberately so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t use a lot of network bandwidth). The resolution is 640x480 at 3 fps. Usually there is not much going on (which is good) but when something does happen I always thought it would be good to have some automatic processing, and TensorFlow seemed like a great way to do that. I followed one of the [tutorials on a single frame][TensorFlow Object Detection], and it picked out quite a lot of detail, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Home Assistant REST Devices and Sensors</title><link>https://dev.codewrite.co.uk/posts/2022-12-22-hassconfigfiles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dev.codewrite.co.uk/posts/2022-12-22-hassconfigfiles/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A while back (before I was using Home Assistant) I built a COB light controller board. The idea was to have lights under the eaves all round the outside of our house (bungalow). They look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dev.codewrite.co.uk/images/COBLightsInHASS/LightsUnderEaves.jpg" alt="COB Lights under Eaves"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this picture there are three lights, but around the rest of the house there are about 15 in total on 4 different circuits. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the detail here other than to say that there is a controller board up in the loft that uses a Wemos D1 mini which serves up a REST interface to turn the lights on and off. I did a presentation for the London Raspberry Pi group.

I plan to use HASS for other automation tasks, maybe controlling things in the garden (e.g. watering plants in the greenhouse) and inside to turn the heating on and off. In this post will describe what I currently have and some ideas for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason that I like HASS is that it separates functionality, specifically keeping the configuration and control logic away from the sensors and devices. This makes everything much more scalable and maintainable. I could write the software to control everything, but like most software engineers I would rather not reinvent the wheel, especially when you have something like HASS that does such a good job with much less effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>NRF24L01 on Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://dev.codewrite.co.uk/posts/2020-06-07-raspberrypinrf24l01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dev.codewrite.co.uk/posts/2020-06-07-raspberrypinrf24l01/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;OK, so just for the record, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried using the NRF24L01 on the Raspberry Pi (via tha GPIO SPI pins) and I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the following is just a record of what I did, in case I ever change my mind :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi code consisted of two python files which had to be in the same folder:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dotnet Core on Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://dev.codewrite.co.uk/posts/2020-04-15-rasperrypianddotnet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dev.codewrite.co.uk/posts/2020-04-15-rasperrypianddotnet/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s project has been writing the software for my GPIO board on my Raspberry Pi. I added this board to a case I bought for my Raspberry Pi 3+.
I designed the GPIO board with a few things in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted a couple of buttons so I could do things like shutting the Pi down (it&amp;rsquo;s not a good idea to just unplug the power)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted a couple of LEDs so I could display a simple status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to control the fan so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t on all the time, just when it was needed (like a laptop fan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The piezo sounder was added because there was space - so maybe I&amp;rsquo;d be able to get the Pi to do audible notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This was mainly for when I was running the Raspberry Pi headless - so there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a screen or keyboard connected.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
