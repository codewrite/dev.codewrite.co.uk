This week's project has been writing the software for my GPIO board on my Raspberry Pi. I added this board to a case I bought for my Raspberry Pi 3+.
I designed the GPIO board with a few things in mind:

- I wanted a couple of buttons so I could do things like shutting the Pi down (it's not a good idea to just unplug the power)
- I wanted a couple of LEDs so I could display a simple status
- I wanted to control the fan so it wasn't on all the time, just when it was needed (like a laptop fan)
- The piezo sounder was added because there was space - so maybe I'd be able to get the Pi to do audible notifications

_\[This was mainly for when I was running the Raspberry Pi headless - so there wouldn't be a screen or keyboard connected.\]_

This is the case with the board in it:

I followed a few articles from the internet, [this one from Scott Hanselman][hanselman-remote-debugging] was very useful to get me started.
